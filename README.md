# CollegeBuddy

## Overview

CollegeBuddy is a platform designed to connect college students, enabling seamless team formations for collaborative projects and providing access to a range of off-campus opportunities critical for academic and professional growth.

## Problem

College students often encounter challenges in finding compatible team members for hackathons, projects, and study groups. Additionally, they frequently miss out on important off-campus opportunities, such as scholarships, events, internships, and job prospects, impacting their educational and career development. The lack of a centralized, easily accessible platform for these opportunities hampers users' abilities to explore and apply for programs relevant to their interests and aspirations. This fragmented landscape leads to missed opportunities and a lack of transparency in accessing these valuable programs.

It also curates a comprehensive list of off-campus opportunities, ensuring students are informed and empowered to take advantage of these prospects. It aims to offer a streamlined, user-friendly interface where individuals can effortlessly explore, apply, and manage diverse opportunities in their respective fields. By consolidating information and functionalities into a single platform, users can efficiently navigate and engage with different programs, enhancing their chances of participation and maximizing the benefits of these opportunities
